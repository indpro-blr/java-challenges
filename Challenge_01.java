/*
 * If str1 = “code” and str2=”cportde”
 * then str1 is a subsequence of str2 as you can get all the
 * characters of str1 in str2 in the same order by deleting some of
 * the characters in str2.
 * For this problem output should return boolean.
 * Input :
 * s1 = "code"
 * s2 = "cportde"
 * Output :
 * true
 * What is the time complexity?
